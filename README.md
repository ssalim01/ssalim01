# About me üëãüèº

Hi there! I'm currently a Bioinformatics MSc student at Queen Mary University of London, building on a solid foundation in Biomedical sciences with Genomics BSc. I am deeply passionate about all things Bioinformatics, Genomics, Machine Learning, and Data Science.

Here's a bit about my technical skills and tools I frequently use:
