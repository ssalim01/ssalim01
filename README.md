# About me 👋🏼

Hi! I’m a PhD researcher at University College London’s Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, funded by the British Heart Foundation Centre for Research Excellence (BHF CRE).
I apply genomic analysis, statistical genetics, and deep learning to investigate the genetic architecture of left atrial appendage morphology and its role in thromboembolic risk among atrial fibrillation patients. My work integrates multi-omics and imaging data to bridge genetic variation with cardiac structure and function.

🧠 Research & Technical Interests:
Cardiovascular Genomics — GWAS, polygenic risk scores, Mendelian randomisation
Computational Imaging — cardiac CT/MRI segmentation, morphological quantification
Machine Learning & Deep Learning — CNNs for medical image analysis, feature extraction
Statistical Genetics — fine-mapping, pathway enrichment, gene prioritisation
Data Science & HPC — Python, R, Bash, PLINK, MONAI, PyTorch, UK Biobank data
